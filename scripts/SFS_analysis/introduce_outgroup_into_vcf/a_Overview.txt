1.	Download the whole genome data of capsella rubella as a fastq file
	a.	I downloaded https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX1077195%5baccn%5dis since it promised a good coverage because of its size

2.	Map it on Arabidopsis thaliana to to get a bam file
	a.	reference genome: Tair.10.1.genomic.fna
	b.	see scripts

3.	Call Snps on bam to get a second vcf
4.	Intersect and merge
5.	R-analysis
